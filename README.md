STM32F0..F (TSSOP20) Breakout Module
====================================

A breakout module for STM32F0 microcontrollers in TSSOP20 footprint.

Basic Features
--------------

Focus on small footprint and direct access to all pins.

Provides a 8 pin Micro-MaTch header for easy access to SWD and UART.

Pushbutton for Reset (press <1 second) and starting the bootloader (press >3 seconds).

Onboard LDO regulator (standart SOT-23-5) can be used for VDD and VDDA, just VDD or disabled completely.

Use of a crystal (SMT 3.2x2.5mm) is optional.

Options can be configured using solder bridges.

Power LED and User LED (on PA0, PF1 or disconnected).
